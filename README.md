## What MicroLoanX Solves

Financial exclusion affects over 1.7 billion people worldwide who lack access to traditional banking services. MicroLoanX addresses this by:

- **Eliminating KYC barriers** while maintaining trust through decentralized identity
- **Enabling cross-border lending** with instant settlements via RLUSD
- **Building reputation without revealing identity** through pseudonymous profiles
- **Providing automated escrow protection** using XRP Ledger's native functionality
- **Reducing lending costs** through blockchain efficiency

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm package manager
- Git

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hackathon2025xrp.git
cd hackathon2025xrp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## XRP Ledger Integration

### Network Configuration
- **Network**: XRPL Testnet (`wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233`)
- **Currency**: RLUSD (Ripple USD stablecoin)
- **Explorer**: [XRPL Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.xrpl.org)

### Key XRPL Features Used

1. **Native Escrow Objects** - Trustless loan agreements with time-based or conditional release
2. **RLUSD Stablecoin** - Stable value lending without cryptocurrency volatility
3. **Trust Lines** - Multi-currency support within the XRP ecosystem
4. **Memo Fields** - On-chain metadata for loan transparency
5. **Instant Settlement** - 3-4 second transaction finality

### Current Implementation Status

**Working Features:**
- XRPL Testnet connectivity
- Real XRP transactions for loan funding/repayment
- Account balance checking with RLUSD support
- Transaction history tracking
- Testnet explorer integration

**In Development:**
- Full RLUSD trust line implementation
- Production escrow contracts
- Automated loan lifecycle management
- Enhanced reputation algorithms

## Development

### Available Scripts

# Development server with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Project Structure Guidelines

- All new code should use TypeScript
- Follow the existing component patterns
- Use the established styling system (Tailwind + custom CSS)
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive code comments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database initialization fails:**
- Refresh the page to retry initialization
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Clear browser storage if issues persist

**XRPL connection problems:**
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check if XRPL testnet is operational
- Look for connection errors in browser console

**User switching not working:**
- Wait for database initialization to complete
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that test data has loaded properly

### Debug Information

Open browser developer tools to see detailed logs:
- Database operations and initialization status
- XRPL connection and transaction details
- User switching and authentication flow
- Error messages and stack traces

## Known Limitations

### Current Demo Limitations

1. **Mock escrow system** - Uses simulated blockchain transactions for demo
2. **Local data storage** - Data resets when browser storage is cleared
3. **Single session** - No persistent user authentication
4. **Testnet only** - Not connected to XRP Ledger mainnet

### Planned Improvements

1. **Real XRPL escrow integration** with production contracts
2. **Persistent user sessions** with secure authentication
3. **IPFS metadata storage** for decentralized loan data
4. **Mainnet deployment** with real RLUSD transactions
5. **Enhanced security** with production-grade practices

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Enhancement
- Complete RLUSD trust line integration
- Implement real XRPL escrow contracts
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Improve mobile responsiveness

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Multi-currency loan support
- Lending pool functionality
- Advanced reputation algorithms
- Social verification systems

### Phase 3: Production Ready
- Mainnet deployment
- Real DID integration with established standards
- Regulatory compliance framework
- Mobile application development
- Partnership integrations
